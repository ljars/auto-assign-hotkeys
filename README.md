# auto-assign-hotkeys
Addon for SURIYUN's MMORPG KIT (v1.70f)

## Installation
1. Import the `Auto Assign Hotkeys` folder.
2. Should work out of the box (no core changes).
3. Can edit the IDs of the hotkeys on the GameInstance object (in your Init scene(s)). They are set to `{"1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8", "9", "0"}` by default, which matches the kit's default hotkey IDs.

## Uninstallation
* Delete the `Auto Assign Hotkeys` folder.

## Disable Without Uninstalling
* Toggle `autoAssignHotkeys` on the GameInstance component to false.
